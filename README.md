# metagenome_vector_sketches
Repository with code to sketch genomic data with random projection

## Counting Examples

This repository includes example scripts that demonstrate counting loops, which are fundamental building blocks for processing genomic data:

### count_to_1000.py
A simple script that counts from 1 to 1000 using a basic for loop. This demonstrates the most straightforward counting pattern.

Usage:
```bash
python3 count_to_1000.py
# or
./count_to_1000.py
```

### advanced_counting.py
Demonstrates various counting patterns that are commonly used in genomic data processing:
- Simple for loop counting
- While loop counting
- Step counting (by increments)
- Reverse counting
- Enumerate counting (useful for sequence processing)

Usage:
```bash
python3 advanced_counting.py
# or
./advanced_counting.py
```

These counting patterns can be adapted for various genomic data processing tasks such as:
- Iterating over genomic positions
- Processing vector sketches
- Handling sequence data
- Managing random projections
